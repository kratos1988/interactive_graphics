 This repository contains the software of the final project for Interactive Graphics exam with professor Marco Schaerf.
 
 The project is made in Javascript and shows a space shuttle wandering around the solar space. The user moves the shuttle with  the keyboard and turn in every direction the view for a better fun :)
